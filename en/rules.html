          <p class="subtitle" style="max-width: 680px;">
            These rules exist to protect the driver, their car, and their income
            first. By using BoomBoom Taxi, passenger and driver confirm agreement
            with the terms below.
          </p>

          <div class="features" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr;">
            <div class="feature">
              <strong>1. Role of the service</strong>
              BoomBoom Taxi is a technology platform connecting passengers and
              drivers. The service is not a transportation company and does not
              take responsibility for vehicle condition or traffic compliance —
              the driver is responsible. The trip is provided by the driver in
              their own car.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>2. Passenger responsibility for the car</strong>
              The driver’s car is personal property and can be expensive.
              Passengers must treat the interior and exterior with care: do not
              stain, scratch, or break interior elements or equipment; do not
              damage belts, handles, headrests, or other parts. Any damage must
              be fully compensated.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>3. Food, drinks, and cleanliness</strong>
              During the trip, food or drinks that can spill, smell, or make a
              mess (coffee, juices, fast food, etc.) are not allowed. The driver
              may ask to put food/drinks away before the ride or refuse the trip.
              If cleaning or detailing is needed because of the passenger (spills,
              dirty shoes on seats, trash), the passenger must cover cleaning
              costs and any downtime.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>4. Traveling with animals</strong>
              Animals are allowed only if they are in a carrier/container or on a
              protective mat/cover. The driver may refuse the trip if the animal
              is without a carrier, heavily shedding, wet, dirty, or could damage
              the interior. If the animal causes mess or damage, the passenger is
              fully responsible and compensates losses.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>5. Driver’s right to refuse a trip</strong>
              The driver may decline an order if the passenger is aggressive,
              heavily intoxicated, carrying prohibited items, bringing an animal
              without a carrier, or if there is a risk to the interior or safety.
              The driver can refuse without detailed explanation if they see risk.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>6. Payment and protecting driver income</strong>
              The passenger must pay according to the driver’s rate and service
              rules. Payment can be cash, card, or cryptocurrency. The driver
              receives the amount minus platform commission. If payment is
              refused, the service may block the passenger and assist with debt
              recovery.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>7. Changing the route</strong>
              Passenger and driver may adjust the route by mutual agreement.
              Cost recalculates automatically by actual distance and time. If
              the change increases cost, the passenger pays the new amount. The
              driver may refuse a change if it is unsafe or unprofitable.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>8. Passenger behavior and safety</strong>
              Passengers must not act aggressively, insult or threaten the driver,
              interfere with vehicle control, distract the driver, smoke in the
              car, or consume alcohol/drugs during the trip. If rules are broken,
              the driver may end the trip early and drop the passenger off in a
              safe place.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>9. Ratings, complaints, and blocks</strong>
              Driver and passenger rate each other after the trip. If a passenger
              repeatedly breaks rules, damages the car, refuses payment, or
              threatens drivers, the service may temporarily or permanently block
              the account. In disputes, protecting the driver, their property,
              and working time is the priority.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>10. Conflicts and damage compensation</strong>
              In disputes, the driver may provide photos/videos of the car,
              chat history, route, and other evidence. The service reviews the
              case and may: support a compensation claim, block the passenger,
              limit functionality, or pass materials to authorities.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>11. Protecting driver personal data</strong>
              The platform does not disclose a driver’s personal data to
              passengers: home address, personal phone number, documents, etc.
              Communication and data transfer happen through protected service
              channels.
            </div>

            <div class="feature">
              <strong>12. Updating the rules</strong>
              BoomBoom Taxi may update these rules. The latest version is
              published on the site. Continuing to use the platform means you
              accept the new terms.
